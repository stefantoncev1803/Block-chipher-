# Block-chipher

#This program is based on task, given in 3th year of TU Sofia
#User enteres word/sentece, then pgrogram generates key with 5 random numbers up to 5, than splits the sentence into blocks of 5 words and playes the position of the latter based on the key - example "hello" , key - 3521 , result - loeh. This is done for all of the blocks.
